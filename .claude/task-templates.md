- **2 points**: Small feature or bug fix (few hours)
- **3 points**: Small feature requiring some design (half day)
- **5 points**: Medium feature, well understood (1-2 days)
- **8 points**: Large feature, some unknowns (3-5 days)
- **13 points**: Complex feature, many unknowns (1-2 weeks)
- **21 points**: Epic-sized, break down into smaller tasks

## Claude Code Integration Tips

1. **Reference tasks in commits**: Use "TASK-XXX" in commit messages
2. **Update status regularly**: Keep TASKS.md current
3. **Link to code**: Reference file paths and line numbers in tasks
4. **Session continuity**: Always check TASKS.md when starting new session
5. **Template usage**: Copy templates for consistency
